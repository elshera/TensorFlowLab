This series of labs, uses **TensorFlow** to label images of English letters! The data used, <a href="http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.com/2011/09/notmnist-dataset.html">notMNIST</a>, consists of images of a letter from A to J in differents font.

The above images are a few examples of the data you'll be training onused for the training. After training the network, will compare the prediction model against test data. The goal is to make predictions against that test set with at least an 80% accuracy.

***
The first lab aims to download the data and save them into a pickle format. The second lab is about loading the previous data and use tensorflow to create a single layer neural network. Lab 3 creates a multilayer perceptron. It is recomended to do the labs in sequence by not skipping any of them
